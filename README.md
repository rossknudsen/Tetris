# Tetris

A remake of the traditional game of Tetris that I remember playing as a kid.  I wrote this for a second year University assignment
but thought that it would be nice to share it.

I built the game using Game Maker and being a coder, I have not really used the WYSIWYG editor to build the game, but used the 
scripting engine instead.  This means that more of the game's functionality is located in one place making understanding and 
debugging easier.

If you find any bugs, please let me know.
